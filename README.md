# Tetris like game for raspberry pi pico and Pimoroni's pico display

1. Uses Pimoroni's micropython
2. Requires a raspberry pi pico microcontroller
3. Requires a Pimoroni's pico display connected to the pico

## nahog/picodisplay-emulator 

Has a copy of a display emulator that draws on a windows instead of using the real pico (at least for simple graphics)
